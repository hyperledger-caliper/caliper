## Caliper Introduction

Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework, which allows users to test different blockchain solutions with predefined use cases, and get a set of performance test results.

**Currently supported blockchain solutions:**
* [Hyperledger Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow)
* [Hyperledger Composer](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer)
* [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/)
* [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
* [FISCO BCOS](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS)
* [Hyperledger Iroha](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha)
* [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core)

Steps for configuring a benchmark that targets a supported blockchain technology are given in the following pages:

- [Burrow](./Burrow_Configuration.md)
- [Composer](./Composer_Configuration.md)
- [Ethereum](./Ethereum_Configuration.md)
- [Fabric](./Fabric_Configuration.md)
- [FISCO BCOS](./FISCO_BCOS_Configuration.md)
- [Iroha](./Iroha_Configuration.md)
- [Sawtooth](./Sawtooth_Configuration.md)

**Currently supported performance indicators:**
* Success rate
* Transaction/Read throughput
* Transaction/Read latency(minimum, maximum, average, percentile)
* Resource consumption (CPU, Memory, Network IO,...)

See [PSWG](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/pswg/performance-and-scale-wg) to find out the definitions and corresponding measurement methods.  

## Architecture
See the [Architecture Introduction](./Architecture.md) page.

## Installing Caliper
See the [Installing and Running Caliper](./Installing_Caliper.md) page.

## Caliper Flow Control

The default Caliper lifecycle is:
- Start SUT (using a `start` command in the network configuration file)
- Initialize the SUT
- Install smart contracts
- Perform the benchmark test
- Tear down SUT (using an `end` command in the network configuration file)

In some cases it is desirable to run a subset of the complete Caliper lifecycle. It is possible to do this by using command line flags:

To skip a phase:
- `caliper-flow-skip-start` skip the start command within the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-skip-init` skip the blockchain init() function that is used to configure an existing blockchain network
- `caliper-flow-skip-install` skip the installation of any smart contracts listed in the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-skip-test` skip the benchmark test
- `caliper-flow-skip-end` skip the end command within the network configuration file

One or more `skip` flags may be specified at a time, but may not be used in conjunction with `only` flags.

To only run a single phase:
- `caliper-flow-only-start` only run the start command within the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-only-init` only run the blockchain init() function that is used to configure an existing blockchain network
- `caliper-flow-only-install` only install the smart contracts listed in the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-only-test` only run the benchmark test
- `caliper-flow-only-end` only run the end command within the network configuration file

Only one `only` flag is permitted to be supplied at a time, and may not be used in conjuction with a `skip` flag. For instance, given that a blockchain network has been created, configured and has smart contracts installed, to run the benchmark test, the following command would be used:

```bash
caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ./packages/caliper-samples --caliper-benchconfig benchmark/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peercouchdb/fabric-node.yaml --caliper-flow-only-test
```
