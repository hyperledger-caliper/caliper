## Overview

Caliper is published as the [@hyperledger/caliper-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperledger/caliper-cli) NPM package and the [hyperledger/caliper](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/caliper) Docker image, both containing the CLI binary.

Installing and running Caliper consists of the following steps, thoroughly detailed by the remaining sections:
1. Acquire the Caliper CLI either from NPM or from DockerHub.
2. Execute a _bind_ command through the CLI. This step pulls the specified version of SDK packages for the selected platform.
3. Start the benchmark through the CLI or by starting the Docker container.

> __Note:__ The examples in the rest of the documentation use the [caliper-benchmarks](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks) repository as the Caliper _workspace_ since it contains many sample artifacts for benchmarking. If you are running your custom benchmark, then change this directory path (and other related configurations) accordingly in the examples.

## The Caliper CLI

Unless you are embedding the Caliper packages in your own application, you will probably use Caliper through its command line interface (CLI). The other sections will introduce the different ways of acquiring and calling the Caliper CLI. This section simply focuses on the API it provides.

> __Note:__ The following examples assume a locally installed CLI in the `~/caliper-benchmarks` directory, hence the `npx` call before the `caliper` binary. 

The entry point of the CLI is the `caliper` binary. You can confirm whether the CLI is installed correctly by checking its version:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npx caliper --version
v0.2.0
```

The CLI provides multiple commands to perform different tasks. To check the available commands and their descriptions, execute:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npx caliper --help
caliper <command>

Commands:
  caliper benchmark <subcommand>   Caliper benchmark command
  caliper bind [options]           Bind Caliper to a specific SUT and its SDK version

Options:
  --help         Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version  Show version number  [boolean]

Examples:
  caliper bind
  caliper benchmark run

For more information on Hyperledger Caliper: https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/
```

You can also request the help page of a specific command, as demonstrated by the next subsections.

> __Note:__ the command options can be set either through the command line, or from various other sources supported by the [configuration mechanism](./Runtime_Configuration.md) of Caliper. This flexibility makes it easy to embed the CLI in different environments.

### The bind command

Acquiring Caliper is as easy as installing a single NPM package, or pulling a single Docker image. However, this single point of install necessitates an additional step of telling Caliper which platform to target and which platform SDK version to use. This step is called _binding_, provided by the `bind` CLI command. 

To have a look at the help page of the command, execute:
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npx caliper bind --help
Usage:
  caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric --caliper-bind-sdk 1.4.1 --caliper-bind-cwd ./ --caliper-bind-args="-g"

Options:
  --help               Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version        Show version number  [boolean]
  --caliper-bind-sut   The name of the platform to bind to  [string]
  --caliper-bind-sdk   Version of the platform SDK to bind to  [string]
  --caliper-bind-cwd   The working directory for performing the SDK install  [string]
  --caliper-bind-args  Additional arguments to pass to "npm install". Use the "=" notation when setting this parameter  [string]
```

 The binding step technically consists of an extra `npm install` call with the appropriate packages and install settings, fully managed by the CLI. The following parameters can be set for the command:
 
 * __SUT/platform name:__ specifies the name of the target platform, e.g., `fabric`
 * __SDK version:__ specifies the SDK version to install for the SUT, e.g., `1.4.0`
 * __Working directory:__ the directory from which the `npm install` command must be performed. Defaults to the current working directory
 * __User arguments:__ additional arguments to pass to `npm install`, e.g., `--save`

The following SUT name (column header) and SDK version (column value) combinations are supported:


| besu   | burrow | composer | ethereum | fabric | fisco-bcos | iroha  | sawtooth |
|:------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:----------:|:------:|:--------:|
| 1.3.2  | 0.23.0 | 0.20.8   | 1.2.1    | 1.0.0  | 2.0.0      | 0.6.3  | 1.0.0    |
| latest | latest | latest   | latest   | 1.1.0  | latest     | latest | 1.0.1    |
|        |        |          |          | 1.2.0  |            |        | 1.0.2    |
|        |        |          |          | 1.3.0  |            |        | 1.0.4    |
|        |        |          |          | 1.4.0  |            |        | 1.0.5    |
|        |        |          |          | 1.4.1  |            |        | latest   |
|        |        |          |          | 1.4.3  |            |        |          |
|        |        |          |          | 1.4.4  |            |        |          |
|        |        |          |          | latest |            |        |          |


> __Note:__ the `latest` value always points to the last explicit versions in the columns. However, it is recommended to explicitly specify the SDK version to avoid any surprise between two benchmark runs.

### The benchmark command

Once the CLI is bound to a specific platform and SDK version, the `benchmark run` CLI command can be used to start a benchmark. 

To have a look at the help page of the command, execute:
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npx caliper benchmark run --help
caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ~/myCaliperProject --caliper-benchconfig my-app-test-config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig my-sut-config.yaml

Options:
  --help                   Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version            Show version number  [boolean]
  --caliper-benchconfig    Path to the benchmark workload file that describes the test client(s), test rounds and monitor.  [string]
  --caliper-networkconfig  Path to the blockchain configuration file that contains information required to interact with the SUT  [string]
  --caliper-workspace      Workspace directory that contains all configuration information  [string]
```

The command requires the following parameters to be set:
* __Workspace:__ the directory serving as the root of your project. Every relative path in other configuration files or settings will be resolved from this directory. The workspace concept was introduced to make Caliper projects portable across different machines.
* __Benchmark configuration file:__ the path of the file containing the configuration of the test rounds, as detailed in the [Architecture page](./Architecture.md#configuration-file). _Should be relative_ to the workspace path. 
* __Network configuration file:__ the path of the file containing the network configuration/description for the selected SUT, detailed in the configuration pages of the respective adapters. _Should be relative_ to the workspace path.

## Installing from NPM

Caliper is published as the [@hyperledger/caliper-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperledger/caliper-cli) NPM package, providing a single point of install for every supported adapter.

### Pre-requisites

The following tools are required to install the CLI from NPM:
* node-gyp, python2, make, g++ and git (for fetching and compiling some packages during install)
* Node.js v8.X LTS or v10.X LTS (for running Caliper)
* Docker and Docker Compose (only needed when running local examples, or using Caliper through its Docker image)

### Local NPM install

> __Note:__ this is the highly recommended way to install Caliper for your project. Keeping the project dependencies local makes it easier to setup multiple Caliper projects. Global dependencies would require re-binding every time before a new benchmark run (to ensure the correct global dependencies). 

1. Set your NPM project details with `npm init` (or just execute `npm init -y`) in your workspace directory (if you haven't done this already, i.e., you don't have a `package.json` file).
2. Install the Caliper CLI (optionally specifying the version, e.g., `@hyperledger/caliper-cli@0.2.0`).
3. Bind the CLI to the required platform SDK (e.g., `fabric` with the `1.4.0` SDK).
4. Invoke the local CLI binary (using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)) with the appropriate parameters. You can repeat this step for as many Fabric 1.4.0 benchmarks as you would like.
 
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npm init -y
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npm install --only=prod @hyperledger/caliper-cli
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npx caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric --caliper-bind-sdk 1.4.0
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ npx caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace . --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml
```

> __Note:__ specifying the `--only=prod` parameter in step 2 will ensure that the default __latest__ SDK dependencies for __every__ platform will __not__ be installed. Since we perform an explicit binding anyway (and only for a single platform), this is the desired approach, while also saving some storage and time.

> __Note:__ always make sure that the versions of the SUT, the bound SDK and the used artifacts match!

### Global NPM install

> __Note:__ make sure that you have a really good reason for installing the Caliper CLI globally. The recommended approach is the local install. That way your project is self-contained and you can easily setup multiple projects (in multiple directories) that each target a different SUT (or just different SUT versions). Installing or re-binding dependencies globally can get tricky. 

There are some minor differences compared to the local install:
1. You don't need a `package.json` file.
2. You can perform the install, bind and run steps from anywhere (just specify the workspace accordingly).
3. You need to install the CLI globally (`-g` flag).
4. You need to tell the binding step to install the packages also globally (`--caliper-bind-args` parameter).
5. You can omit the `npx` command, since `caliper` will be in your `PATH`. 

```console
user@ubuntu:~$ npm install -g --only=prod @hyperledger/caliper-cli
user@ubuntu:~$ caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric --caliper-bind-sdk 1.4.0 --caliper-bind-args=-g
user@ubuntu:~$ caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ~/caliper-benchmarks --caliper-benchconfig benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml
```

> __Note:__ for global install you don't need to change the directory to your workspace, you can simply specify `--caliper-workspace ~/caliper-benchmarks`. But this way you can't utilize the auto complete feature of your commandline for the relative artifact paths. 

Depending on your NPM settings, your user might need write access to directories outside of its home directory. This usually results in _"Access denied"_ errors. The following pointers can guide you to circumvent this problem:

1. Check your global NPM install directory: `npm config get prefix`
2. If the path is outside of your user's home directory:
  * Grant write permission to your user for that directory
  * Try using sudo: `sudo npm install -g --only=prod @hyperledger/caliper-cli`
  * Or change the global install path to a local directory (`~/.local` in the example below) and add it to `PATH`:
    ```console
    user@ubuntu:~$ mkdir ~/.local && npm config set prefix ~/.local
    ```
  * Or just install the package locally instead.

## Using the Docker image

Caliper is published as the [hyperledger/caliper](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/caliper) Docker image, providing a single point of usage for every supported adapter. The image builds upon the [node:10.16-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image to keep the image size as low as possible. 

The following default attributes are set for the image:
* Working directory: `/hyperledger/caliper`
* Environment variable `CALIPER_WORKSPACE` is set to the `/hyperledger/caliper/workspace` directory
* Default command: `npx caliper bind && npx caliper benchmark run`
* The above command is executed by the `root` user

This has the following implications:
1. It is recommended to mount your local workspace to the `/hyperledger/caliper/workspace` container directory. The default `CALIPER_WORKSPACE` environment variable value points to this location, so you don't need to specify it explicitly, one less setting to modify.
2. The binding step is still necessary, similarly to the NPM install approach. The default command already includes the binding step, you only need to set its required parameters. The easiest way to do this is through the `CALIPER_BIND_SUT` and `CALIPER_BIND_SDK` environment variables. 
3. The default command also includes the run step, you only need to set its required parameters. The easiest way to do this is through the `CALIPER_BENCHCONFIG` and `CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG` environment variables. 
4. If you followed the advices in the above points, then you can leave the default command as it is, thus the command for running the container will remain simple (especially when used with `docker-compose`).

### Starting a container

Parts of starting a Caliper container (following the recommendations above):
1. Pick the required image version/tag
2. Mount your local working directory to a container directory
3. Set the required binding and run parameters

> __Note:__ the __latest__ tag is __not supported__, i.e, you explicitly have to specify the image version/tag you want: `hyperledger/caliper:0.2.0`  

Putting it all together, split into multiple lines for clarity, and naming the container `caliper`:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ docker run \
    -v .:/hyperledger/caliper/workspace \
    -e CALIPER_BIND_SUT=fabric \
    -e CALIPER_BIND_SDK=1.4.0 \
    -e CALIPER_BENCHCONFIG=benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml \
    -e CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG=networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml \
    --name caliper hyperledger/caliper:0.2.0
```

> __Note:__ the above network configuration file contains a start script to spin up a local Docker-based Fabric network, which will not work in this form. So make sure to remove the start (and end) script, and change the node endpoints to remote addresses.

### Using docker-compose

The above command is more readable when converted to a `docker-compose.yaml` file:
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
    caliper:
        container_name: caliper
        image: hyperledger/caliper:0.2.0
        environment:
        - CALIPER_BIND_SUT=fabric
        - CALIPER_BIND_SDK=1.4.0
        - CALIPER_BENCHCONFIG=benchmarks/scenario/simple/config.yaml
        - CALIPER_NETWORKCONFIG=networks/fabric/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-go.yaml
        volumes:
        - ~/caliper-benchmarks:/home/node/hyperledger/caliper/workspace
```

Once you navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file, just execute:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

> __Note:__ if you would like to test a locally deployed SUT, then you also need to add the necessary SUT containers to the above file and make sure that Caliper starts last (using the `depends_on` attribute).

## Installing locally from source

> __Note:__ this section is intended only for developers who would like to modify the Caliper code-base and experiment with the changes locally before raising pull requests. You should perform the following steps every time you make a modification you want to test, to correctly propagate any changes.

The workflow of modifying the Caliper code-base usually consists of the following steps:
1. [Bootstrapping the repository](#bootstrapping-the-caliper-repository)
2. [Modifying and testing the code](#testing-the-code)
3. [Publishing package changes locally](#publishing-to-local-npm-repository)
4. [Building the Docker image](#building-the-docker-image)

### Bootstrapping the Caliper repository

To install the basic dependencies of the repository, and to resolve the cross-references between the different packages in the repository, you must execute the following commands from the root of the repository directory:
1. `npm i`: Installs development-time dependencies, such as [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme) and the license checking package.
2. `npm run repoclean`: Cleans up the `node_modules` directory of all packages in the repository. Not needed for a freshly cloned repository.
3. `npm run bootstrap`: Installs the dependencies of all packages in the repository and links any cross-dependencies between the packages. It will take some time to finish installation. If it is interrupted by `ctrl+c`, please recover the `package.json` file first and then run `npm run bootstrap` again.

Or as a one-liner:
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper$ npm i && npm run repoclean -- --yes && npm run bootstrap
```

> __Note:__ do not run any of the above commands with `sudo`, as it will cause the bootstrap process to fail.

### Testing the code

The easiest way to test your changes is to run the CI process locally. Currently, the CI process runs benchmarks for specific adapters. You can trigger these tests by running the following script from the root directory of the repository, setting the `BENCHMARK` environment variable to the platform name:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper$ BENCHMARK=fabric ./.travis/avoid_verdaccio.sh
```

The following platform tests (i.e., valid `BENCHMARK` values) are available:
* besu
* ethereum
* fabric
* fisco-bcos
* sawtooth

The scripts will perform the following tests (also necessary for a successful pull request):
* Linting checks
* Licence header checks
* Unit tests
* Running sample benchmarks

If you would like to run other examples, then you can directly access the CLI in the `packages/caliper-cli` directory, without publishing anything locally. 

> __Note:__ the SDK dependencies in this case are fixed (the binding step is not supported with this approach), and you can check (and change) them in the `package.json` files of the corresponding packages. In this case the repository needs to be bootstrapped again.

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper$ node ./packages/caliper-cli/caliper.js benchmark run --caliper-workspace ./packages/caliper-samples --caliper-benchconfig benchmark/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-node.yaml
```

### Publishing to local NPM repository

The NPM publishing and installing steps for the modified code-base can be tested through a local NPM proxy server, Verdaccio. The steps to perform are the following:

1. Start a local Verdaccio server to publish to
2. Publish the packages from the Caliper repository to the Verdaccio server
3. Install and bind the CLI from the Verdaccio server
4. Run the integration tests or any sample benchmark

The following commands must be executed from the `packages/caliper-tests-integration` directory:
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper$ cd ./packages/caliper-tests-integration
``` 

#### Starting Verdaccio

To setup and start a local Verdaccio server, run the following npm command:
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npm run start_verdaccio
...
[PM2] Spawning PM2 daemon with pm2_home=.pm2
[PM2] PM2 Successfully daemonized
[PM2] Starting /home/user/projects/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration/node_modules/.bin/verdaccio in fork_mode (1 instance)
[PM2] Done.
┌───────────┬────┬──────┬────────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┬─────┬───────────┬────────┬──────────┐
│ App name  │ id │ mode │ pid    │ status │ restart │ uptime │ cpu │ mem       │ user   │ watching │
├───────────┼────┼──────┼────────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┼─────┼───────────┼────────┼──────────┤
│ verdaccio │ 0  │ fork │ 115203 │ online │ 0       │ 0s     │ 3%  │ 25.8 MB   │ user   │ disabled │
└───────────┴────┴──────┴────────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┴─────┴───────────┴────────┴──────────┘
 Use `pm2 show <id|name>` to get more details about an app
```

The Verdaccio server is now listening on the following address: `http://localhost:4873`

#### Publishing the packages

Once Verdaccio is running, you can run the following command to publish every Caliper package locally:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npm run npm_publish_local
...
+ @hyperledger/caliper-core@0.1.0
[PUBLISH] Published package @hyperledger/caliper-core@0.1.0
...
+ @hyperledger/caliper-fabric@0.1.0
[PUBLISH] Published package @hyperledger/caliper-fabric@0.1.0
...
+ @hyperledger/caliper-cli@0.1.0
[PUBLISH] Published package @hyperledger/caliper-cli@0.1.0
```

#### Running package-based tests

Once the packages are published to the local Verdaccio server, we can use the usual NPM install approach. The only difference is that now we specify the local Verdaccio registry as the install source instead of the default, public NPM registry:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npm install --registry=http://localhost:4873 --only=prod @hyperledger/caliper-cli
user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npx caliper bind --caliper-bind-sut fabric --caliper-bind-sdk 1.4.0
user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npx caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ../caliper-samples --caliper-benchconfig benchmark/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-node.yaml
```

> __Note:__ we used the local registry only for the Caliper packages. The binding happens through the public NPM registry. Additionally, we performed the commands through npx and the newly installed CLI binary (i.e., not directly calling the CLI code file).

### Building the Docker image

Once the modified packages are published to the local Verdaccio server, you can rebuild the Docker image. The Dockerfile is located in the `packages/caliper-tests-integration` directory.

To rebuild a Docker image, execute the following:
```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npm run docker_build_local
...
Successfully tagged hyperledger/caliper:0.1.0
[BUILD] Built Docker image "hyperledger/caliper:0.1.0"
```

Now you can proceed with the Docker-based benchmarking as described in the previous sections.

> __Note:__ once you are done with the locally published packages, you can clean them up the following way:
> ```console
> user@ubuntu:~/caliper/packages/caliper-tests-integration$ npm run cleanup
> ```
