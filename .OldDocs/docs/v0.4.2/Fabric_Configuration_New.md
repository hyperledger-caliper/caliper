## Introducing the new Fabric Connector

This page describes the new fabric connector implementation that replaces the deprecated legacy fabric connector

The differences between the 2 implementations are as follows

> * A more logical network configuration utilising provided connection profiles from a network provider
> * More robust implementation
> * Fixes and improvements will only be done on the new connector implementation
> * The new connector implementation has dropped some of the capability of the old connector
>> * Cannot specify targetPeers during install/instantiate of a contract
>> * storing or reading identities from node-sdk credential/cypto stores is not implemented
>> * Support for automatically registering and enroling identities through a Certificate Authority is not implemented
>> * Cannot specify to use an admin identity in a workload request using the `#ORG2` type notation

How you select which implementation you use is via the provided network configuration file and specifically the version you declare in that file

> * a version of 1.0 selects the legacy connector
> * a version of 2.0.0 selects the new connector

For example

```yaml
name: Fabric
version: "1.0"
```
would select the legacy connector and the file must conform to the old deprecated network configuration file format

```yaml
name: Fabric
version: "2.0.0"
```

would select the new connector and the file must conform to the new network configuration file format


## Overview

This page introduces the Fabric adapter that utilizes the Common Connection Profile (CCP) feature of the Fabric SDK to provide compatibility and a unified programming model across different Fabric versions.

> The latest supported version of Hyperledger Fabric is v2.x
> The ability to discover can only be used if you use the `gateway` option

The adapter exposes many SDK features directly to the user callback modules, making it possible to implement complex scenarios.

> Some highlights of the provided features:
> * supporting multiple orderers
> * supporting multiple channels and contracts
> * metadata and private collection support for contracts
> * support for TLS and mutual TLS communication
> * option to select the identity for submitting a TX/query
> * detailed execution data for every TX

## Installing dependencies

You must bind Caliper to a specific Fabric SDK to target the corresponding (or compatible) SUT version. Refer to the [binding documentation](./Installing_Caliper.md#the-bind-command) for details. It is confirmed that a 1.4 Fabric SDK is compatible with a Fabric 2.1 and 2.2 SUT however any installation or instantiation of contracts (chaincode) will only work if you are still using the old lifecycle implementation.

### Binding with Fabric SDK 2.x
> Note that when using the binding target for the Fabric SDK 2.x there are capability restrictions:
> * The 2.x SDK does not facilitate administration actions. It it not possible to create/join channels, nor install/instantiate contract. Consequently the 2.x binding only facilitates operation with a `--caliper-flow-only-test` flag
> * The 2.x SDK only supports operation using a `gateway`. Consequently the 2.x binding requires a `--caliper-fabric-gateway-enabled` flag

### Using the Operational capabilities of the Adapters
The ability to create channels and perform install/instantiate of contracts (chaincode) remains in the new 1.x sdk based adapters, and nothing equivalent exists for the 2.x sdk based adapters. This capability remains mainly to support the Caliper integration tests and the use of these mechanisms to setup your channels and contracts is highly discouraged. This capability is considered legacy and will not be maintained. You should look into alternative methods for setting up your network prior to running Caliper to benchmark it.

## Runtime settings

### Common settings

Some runtime properties of the adapter can be set through Caliper's [runtime configuration mechanism](./Runtime_Configuration.md). For the available settings, see the `caliper.fabric` section of the [default configuration file](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/v0.4.2/packages/caliper-core/lib/common/config/default.yaml) and its embedded documentation.

The above settings are processed when starting Caliper. Modifying them during testing will have no effect. However, you can override the default values _before Caliper starts_ from the usual configuration sources.

> __Note:__ An object hierarchy in a configuration file generates a setting entry for every leaf property. Consider the following configuration file:
> ```yaml
> caliper:
>   fabric:
>     gateway:
>       localhost: false
>       enabled: true
> ```
> After naming the [project settings](./Runtime_Configuration.md#project-level) file `caliper.yaml` and placing it in the root of your workspace directory, it will override the following two setting keys with the following values:
> * Setting `caliper-fabric-gateway-enabled` is set to `true`
> * Setting `caliper-fabric-gateway-localhost` is set to `false`
>
> __The other settings remain unchanged.__

The setting `caliper-fabric-gateway-discovery` is not supported in these new connectors and should be defined within the configuration file but remains available only to support the legacy fabric connectors.

### Skip channel creation

Additionally, the adapter provides a dynamic setting (family) for skipping the creation of a channel. The setting key format is `caliper-fabric-skipcreatechannel-<channel_name>`. Substitute the name of the channel you want to skip creating into `<channel_name>`, for example:

```console
user@ubuntu:~/caliper-benchmarks$ export CALIPER_FABRIC_SKIPCREATECHANNEL_MYCHANNEL=true
```

> __Note:__ This settings is intended for easily skipping the creation of a channel that is specified in the network configuration file as "not created". However, if you know that the channel always will be created during benchmarking, then it is recommended to denote this explicitly in the network configuration file.

Naturally, you can specify the above setting multiple ways (e.g., command line argument, configuration file entry).

## The connector API

The [workload modules](./Workload_Module.md) interact with the adapter at three phases of the tests: during the initialization of the user module (in the `initializeWorkloadModule` callback), when submitting invoke or query transactions (in the `submitTransaction` callback), and at the optional cleanup of the user module (in the `cleanupWorkloadModule` callback).

### The `initializeWorkloadModule` function

See the [corresponding documentation](./Workload_Module.md#initializeworkloadmodule) of the function for the description of its parameters.

The last argument of the function is a `sutContext` object, which is a platform-specific object provided by the backend blockchain's connector. The context object provided by this connector is a `FabricConnectorContext` instance but this doesn't provide anything of use at this time.

For the current details/documentation of the API, refer to the [source code](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/v0.4.2/packages/caliper-fabric/lib/FabricConnectorContext.js).

### The `submitTransaction` function

The `sutAdapter` object received (and saved) in the `initializeWorkloadModule` function is of type [`ConnectorInterface`](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/v0.4.2/packages/caliper-core/lib/common/core/connector-interface.js). Its `getType()` function returns the `fabric` string value.

The `sendRequests` method of the connector API allows the workload module to submit requests to the SUT. It takes a single parameter: an object or array of objects containing the settings of the requests.

The settings object has the following structure:
* `contractId`: _string. Required._ The ID of the contract to call.
* `contractFunction`: _string. Required._ The name of the function to call in the contract.
* `contractArguments`: _string[]. Optional._ The list of __string__ arguments to pass to the contract.
* `readOnly`: _boolean. Optional._ Indicates whether the request is a TX or a query. Defaults to `false`.
* `timeout`: _number. Optional._ The timeout in seconds to use for this request. This setting is not applicable when gateway use is enabled.
* `transientMap`: _Map<string, byte[]>. Optional._ The transient map to pass to the contract.
* `invokerIdentity`: _string. Optional._ The name of the user who should invoke the contract. If not provided a user will be selected from the organization defined by `invokerMspId` or the first organization in the network configuration file if that property is not provided
* `invokerMspId`: _string. Optional._ The mspid of the user organization who should invoke the contract. Defaults to the first organization in the network configuration file.
* `targetPeers`: _string[]. Optional._ An array of endorsing peer names as the targets of the transaction proposal. If omitted, the target list will be chosen for you. If discovery is used then the node sdk uses discovery to determine the correct peers.
* `targetOrganizations`: _string[]. Optional._ An array of endorsing organizations as the targets of the invoke. If both targetPeers and
are specified then targetPeers will take precedence
* `orderer`: _string. Optional._ The name of the target orderer for the transaction broadcast. If omitted, then an orderer node of the channel will be automatically selected.
* `channel`: _string. Optional._ The name of the channel on which the contract to call resides.

So invoking a contract looks like the following:

```js
let requestSettings = {
    contractId: 'marbles',
    contractFunction: 'initMarble',
    contractArguments: ['MARBLE#1', 'Red', '100', 'Attila'],
    invokerIdentity: 'client0.org2.example.com',
    timeout: 10
};

await this.sutAdapter.sendRequests(requestSettings);
```

> __Note:__ `sendRequests` also accepts an array of request settings. However, Fabric does not support submitting an atomic batch of transactions like Sawtooth, so there is no guarantee that the order of these transactions will remain the same, or whether they will reside in the same block.


## Gathered TX data

The previously discussed  `sendRequests` function returns the result (or an array of results) for the submitted request(s) with the type of [TxStatus](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/blob/v0.4.2/packages/caliper-core/lib/transaction-status.js). The class provides some standard and platform-specific information about its corresponding transaction.

The standard data provided are the following:
* `GetID():string` returns the transaction ID.
* `GetStatus():string` returns the final status of the transaction, either `success` or `failed`.
* `GetTimeCreate():number` returns the epoch when the transaction was submitted.
* `GetTimeFinal():number` return the epoch when the transaction was finished.
* `IsVerified():boolean` indicates whether we are sure about the final status of the transaction. Unverified (considered failed) transactions could occur, for example, if the adapter loses the connection with every Fabric event hub, missing the final status of the transaction.
* `GetResult():Buffer` returns one of the endorsement results returned by the contract as a `Buffer`. It is the responsibility of the user callback to decode it accordingly to the contract-side encoding.

The adapter also gathers the following platform-specific data (if observed) about each transaction, each exposed through a specific key name. The placeholders `<P>` and `<O>` in the key names are node names taking their values from the top-level peers and orderers sections from the network configuration file (e.g., `endorsement_result_peer0.org1.example.com`). The `Get(key:string):any` function returns the value of the observation corresponding to the given key. Alternatively, the `GetCustomData():Map<string,any>` returns the entire collection of gathered data as a `Map`.

The adapter-specific data keys are that are common across both the gateway and non gateway adapters are :

|            Key name            | Data type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|         `request_type`         |  string   | Either the `transaction` or `query` string value for traditional transactions or queries, respectively. |


The adapter-specific data keys that only the v1.x non gateway adapter makes available are :


|            Key name            | Data type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `proposal_response_error_<P>`  |  string   | The error message in case the endorser peer `<P>` returned an error as endorsement result.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|    `endorsement_result_<P>`    |  Buffer   | The encoded contract invocation result returned by the endorser peer `<P>`. It is the user callback's responsibility to decode the result.                                                                                                                                  |
| `endorsement_verify_error_<P>` |  string   | Has the value of `'INVALID'` if the signature and identity of the endorser peer `<P>` couldn't be verified. This verification step can be switched on/off through the [runtime configuration options](#runtime-settings).                                                    |
| `endorsement_result_error<P>`  |  string   | If the transaction proposal or query execution at the endorser peer `<P>` results in an error, this field contains the error message.                                                                                                                                        |
|     `read_write_set_error`     |  string   | Has the value of `'MISMATCH'` if the sent transaction proposals resulted in different read/write sets.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|       `time_orderer_ack`       |  number   | The Unix epoch when the adapter received the confirmation from the orderer that it successfully received the transaction. Note, that this isn't the actual ordering time of the transaction.                                                                                 |
|     `broadcast_error_<O>`      |  string   | The warning message in case the adapter did not receive a successful confirmation from the orderer node `<O>`. Note, that this does not mean, that the transaction failed (e.g., a timeout occurred while waiting for the answer due to some transient network delay/error). |
| `broadcast_response_error_<O>` |  string   | The error message in case the adapter received an explicit unsuccessful response from the orderer node `<O>`.                                                                                                                                                                |
|       `unexpected_error`       |  string   | The error message in case some unexpected error occurred during the life-cycle of a transaction.                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      `commit_timeout_<P>`      |  string   | Has the value of `'TIMEOUT'` in case the event notification about the transaction did not arrive in time from the peer node `<P>`.                                                                                                                                           |
|       `commit_error_<P>`       |  string   | Contains the error code in case the transaction validation fails at the end of its life-cycle on peer node `<P>`.                                                                                                                                                            |
|      `commit_success_<P>`      |  number   | The Unix epoch when the adapter received a successful commit event from the peer node `<P>`. Note, that transactions committed in the same block have nearly identical commit times, since the SDK receives them block-wise, i.e., at the same time.                         |
|     `event_hub_error_<P>`      |  string   | The error message in case some event hub connection-related error occurs with peer node `<P>`.                                                                                                                                                                               |

You can access these data in your workload module after calling `sendRequests`:

```js
let requestSettings = {
    contractId: 'marbles',
    contractVersion: '0.1.0',
    contractFunction: 'initMarble',
    contractArguments: ['MARBLE#1', 'Red', '100', 'Attila'],
    invokerIdentity: 'client0.org2.example.com',
    timeout: 10
};

// single argument, single return value
const result = await this.sutAdapter.sendRequests(requestSettings);

let shortID = result.GetID().substring(8);
let executionTime = result.GetTimeFinal() - result.GetTimeCreate();
console.log(`TX [${shortID}] took ${executionTime}ms to execute. Result: ${result.GetStatus()}`);
```

### The cleanupWorkloadModule function
The `cleanupWorkloadModule` function is called at the end of the round, and can be used to perform any resource cleanup required by your workload implementation.

## Network configuration file reference

The YAML network configuration file of the adapter mainly describes the organizations and the identities associated with those organizations, It also provides explicit information about the channels in your fabric network and the contracts (chaincode) deployed to those channels. It will reference Common Connection Profiles for each organization (as common connection profiles are specific to a single organization). These are the same connection profiles that would be consumed by the node-sdk. Whoever creates the fabric network and channels would be able to provide appropriate profiles for each organization.

The following sections detail each part separately. For a complete example, please refer to the [example section](#network-configuration-example) or one of the files in the [Caliper repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper), such as the caliper-fabric test folder

> __Note:__ Unknown keys are not allowed anywhere in the configuration. The only exception is the `info` property and when network artifact names serve as keys (peer names, channel names, etc.).

*  <details><summary markdown="span">__mspid__
   </summary>
   _Required. Non-empty string._ <br>
   The unique MSP ID of the organization.

*  <details><summary markdown="span">__connectionProfile__
   </summary>
   _Required. Non-empty object._ <br>
   Reference to a fabric network Common Connection Profile. These profiles are the same profiles that the fabric SDKs would consume in order to interact with a fabric network. A Common Connection Profile is organization specific so you need to ensure you point to a Common Connection Profile that is representive of the organization it is being included under. Connection Profiles also can be in 2 forms. A static connection profile will contain a complete description of the fabric network, ie all the peers and orderers as well as all the channels that the organization is part of. A dynamic connection profile will contain a minimal amount of information usually just a list of 1 or more peers belonging to the organization (or is allowed to access) in order to discover the fabric network nodes and channels.

   ```yaml
   organizations:
     - mspid: Org1MSP
     connectionProfile:
      path: './test/sample-configs/Org1ConnectionProfile.yaml'
      discover: true
   ```
   *  <details><summary markdown="span">__path__
      </summary>
      _Required. Non-empty string._ <br>
      The path to the connection profile file

      ```yaml

        - mspid: Org1MSP
        connectionProfile:
          path: './test/sample-configs/Org1ConnectionProfile.yaml'
      ```
      </details>
   *  <details><summary markdown="span">__discover__
      </summary>
      _Optional. Boolean._ <br>
      A value of `true` indicates that the connection profile is a dynamic connection profile and discovery should be used. If not specified then it defaults to false. You can only set this value to true if you plan to use the `gateway` option

      ```yaml
      organizations:

   Some prorperties are required depending on whether a contract needs to be deployed. The following constraints apply:
   > __Note:__
   >
   > Constraints for installing contracts:
   > * if `metadataPath` is provided, `path` is also required
   > * if `path` is provided, `language` is also required
   >
   > Constraints for instantiating contracts:
   > * if any of the following properties are provided, `language` is also needed: `initArguments`, `initFunction`, `initTransientMap`, `collectionsConfig`, `endorsementPolicy`
   Each element can contain the following properties.

   *  <details><summary markdown="span">__id__
      </summary>
      _Required. Non-empty string._ <br>
      The ID of the contract.

      ```yaml
      channels:
        mychannel:
          contracts:
          - id: simple
            # other properties
      ```
      </details>


   *  <details><summary markdown="span">__contractID__
      </summary>
      _Optional. Non-empty string._ <br>
      The Caliper-level unique ID of the contract. This ID will be referenced from the user callback modules. Can be an arbitrary name, it won't effect the contract properties on the Fabric side.

      If omitted, it defaults to the `id` property value.

      ```yaml
      channels:
        mychannel:
          contracts:
          - contractID: simpleContract
            # other properties
      ```
      </details>

   *  <details><summary markdown="span">__install__
      </summary>
      _Optional. Non-empty object_ <br>
      Defines the requirement that the contract (chaincode) will be installed and instantiated. The sub properties provided will define the information about the contract (chaincode) to be installed. This can only be used with a 1.4 SUT and can only be used against a Fabric 2.x network if the new lifecycle has not been enabled.

      ```yaml
      contracts:
      - id: marbles
        contractID: myMarbles
        install:
          version: v0
          language: golang
          path: marbles/go
          metadataPath: src/marbles/go/metadata
      ```
      *  <details><summary markdown="span">__version__
         </summary>
         _Required. Non-empty string._ <br>
         The version string of the contract.

         ```yaml
         channels:
           mychannel:
             contracts:
               install:
                 version: v1.0
                 # other properties
         ```
         </details>

      *  <details><summary markdown="span">__language__
         </summary>
         _Optional. Non-empty string._ <br>
         Denotes the language of the contract. Currently supported values: `golang`, `node` and `java`.

         ```yaml
         channels:
           mychannel:
             contracts:
               install:
                 language: node
                 # other properties
         ```
         </details>

      *  <details><summary markdown="span">__path__
         </summary>
         _Optional. Non-empty string._ <br>
         The path to the contract directory. For golang contracts, it is the fully qualified package name (relative to the `GOPATH/src` directory). Note, that `GOPATH` is temporarily set to the workspace directory by default. To disable this behavior, set the `caliper-fabric-overwritegopath` setting key to `false`.

         ```yaml
         channels:
           mychannel:
             contracts:
               install:
                 path: contracts/mycontract
                 # other properties
         ```
         </details>

      *  <details><summary markdown="span">__metadataPath__
         </summary>
         _Optional. Non-empty string._ <br>
         The directory path for additional metadata for the contract (like CouchDB indexes). Only supported since Fabric v1.1.

         ```yaml
         channels:
           mychannel:
             contracts:
               install:
                 metadataPath: contracts/mycontract/metadata
                 # other properties

      </details>

   *  <details><summary markdown="span">__instantiate__
      </summary>
      _Optional. Non-empty object._ <br>
      Defines the optional parameters to provided during the instantiate phase. This section does not control whether the contact (chaincode) is instantiated or not it just provides the capability to provide optional instantiation parameters. This can only be used with a 1.4 SUT and can only be used against a Fabric 2.x network if the new lifecycle has not been enabled.

      ```yaml
      contracts:
        - id: marbles
          contractID: myMarbles
          # define the install requirements to install chaincode if chaincode is to be installed

         The list of string arguments to pass to the contract's `Init` function during instantiation. Defaults to an empty array if not specified

         ```yaml
         instantiate:
           initArguments: ['arg1', 'arg2']
           # other properties
         ```
         </details>

      *  <details><summary markdown="span">__initFunction__
         </summary>
         _Optional. String._ <br>
         The function name to pass to the contract's `Init` function during instantiation. Defaults to `init` if not specified

           # other properties
         ```
         </details>

         </summary>
         _Optional. Object containing string keys associated with string values._ <br>
         The transient key-value map to pass to the `Init` function when instantiating a contract. The adapter encodes the values as byte arrays before sending them.

         ```yaml
         instantiate:
           initTransientMap:
             pemContent: |
               -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

## Network Configuration Example

The following example is a Fabric network configuration for the following network topology and artifacts:
* two organizations `Org1MSP` and `Org2MSP`
* one channel named `mychannel`
* `marbles@v0` contract installed and instantiated in `mychannel` on every peer;
* the nodes of the network use TLS communication, but not mutual TLS;
* the local network is deployed and cleaned up automatically by Caliper.

```yaml
name: Fabric
version: "2.0.0"

caliper:
  blockchain: fabric
  sutOptions:
    mutualTls: false
  command:
    start: docker-compose -f network/fabric-v1.1/2org2peergoleveldb/docker-compose-tls.yaml up -d;sleep 3s
    end: docker-compose -f network/fabric-v1.1/2org2peergoleveldb/docker-compose-tls.yaml down;docker rm $(docker ps -aq);docker rmi $(docker images dev* -q)
