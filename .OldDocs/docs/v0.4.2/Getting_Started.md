## Caliper Introduction

Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework, which allows users to test different blockchain solutions with custom use cases, and get a set of performance test results.

### Supported blockchain solutions

* [Hyperledger Besu](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu)
* [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/)
* [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
* [FISCO BCOS](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS)

### Supported performance metrics

* Transaction/read throughput
* Transaction/read latency (minimum, maximum, average, percentile)
* Resource consumption (CPU, Memory, Network IO, ...)

See the [PSWG white paper](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/blockchain-performance-metrics) for the exact definitions and corresponding measurement methods.

## Architecture

It helps to have a basic understanding of how Caliper works before diving into the examples. Have a look at the [Architecture](./Architecture.md) page!

## Installing Caliper

Head to the [Install & Usage](./Installing_Caliper.md) page if you want to try Caliper right now. It's as simple as downloading an NPM package or starting a Docker container!

## Sample Networks

Sample benchmarks that may be used by Caliper are hosted on a companion [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper-benchmarks).

Performance reports for the provided samples are hosted on the [documentation pages of the repository](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper-benchmarks/).

> **Important:** make sure that the version/tag of the benchmark repository matches the version of Caliper you are using! For example, if you are using Caliper v0.4.2, then `checkout` the `v0.4.2` tag after cloning the benchmark repository. The `main` branch of the benchmark repository corresponds to the latest `unstable` Caliper version.
